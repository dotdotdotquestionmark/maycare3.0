      Palo Alto Care Homes has served the Bay Area for nearly 25 years.  With locations in Palo Alto and Los Altos, 
      we provide senior care for both ambulatory and non-ambulatory guests in a lovely residential setting.
  
      Our homes were founded in 1987 by Mrs. May Wang and are now operated by her son James.  
      Our caring and professional staff – some of whom have been with us for over 15 years – 
      operate a warm and cheerful environment where your loved ones will feel at home.  
      We ensure that our residents always cared for by having a minimum of two staff members on duty 24/7.  
      We are grateful to be entrusted with the caring and well-being of your loved ones and we work hard to make
      them feel at home and provide them with a peaceful environment with friendly and dependable care.
