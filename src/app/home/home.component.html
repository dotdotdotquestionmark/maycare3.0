                <p>
                  Palo Alto Care Homes has served the Bay Area since 1987. We have two senior care homes: 
                  one in Palo Alto and a second in Los Altos. Both of our homes are staffed by trained, caring 
                  and experienced professionals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At Palo Alto Care Homes, our residents are part of one big 
                  family and when they are with us, we treat them as if they are are part of our very own family.

                <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
                <p>We believe that the basic principle of longevity lies in the harmony and balance of 
                  mental and physical health. Peace of mind and a sense of community will keep the elderly 
                  young at heart and free from worries. We aim to provide a friendly, caring environment that 
                  offers harmony, comfort and security and allows residents to live as they wish.</p>
